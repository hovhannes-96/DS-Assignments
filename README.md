# This repository contains data structures homeworks with unit tests.
Each directory contains a separate assignment.

The requirements are written in source files. For example see Vector/Vector.h and Vector/main.cpp

## Build and run
You just need to compile main.cpp from the directory of a homework.
Uncomment tests of includes for tests to build and run the project.
```
cd HomeworkDirectory
g++ main.cpp -o outputBinaryName
./outputBinaryName
```

## Some hints
