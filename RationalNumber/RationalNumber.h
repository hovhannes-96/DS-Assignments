// Your goal is to create a rational number class that would
// support each of the operations given in main.cpp.
//
// In this file you must declare only the interface of your class
// and implement the given functions separately from the class (at the bottom of
// this file inside the namespace).
// Notice that the RationalNumber is a class template, where the
// template parameter is an integer type for numerator and denominator.
//
// Note - Rename the namespace "yourname" to whatever you want, feel creative
// ( but not too much :) ).
//
// After you wrote RationalNumber class and the tests in the main function work
// - write at the bottom of the file the downsides of such rational numbers,
// what would you change/remove/add? Would you use such rational numbers instead
// of double/float numbers? There is no right/wrong answer, this question is
// more of a philosofical kind than technical.

namespace yourname 
{

class RationalNumber  
{
  
};

} // namespace yourname
